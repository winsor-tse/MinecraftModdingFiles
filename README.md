Adding a Mod

Next you are going to open the mods folder and add your mod to that folder. This is where forge will look for mods to run.

To find the mods folder, run Minecraft.

Go to Options>Resource Packs>Open Resource Pack Folder. This should open a folder either in File Explorer or Finder.

Quit Minecraft. You will re-open it in a bit, but first you need to move the mod around.

Go up one folder. You can use cmd+shift+Up arrow on mac. You should see all the folders Minecraft uses such as saves, screenshots, etc.

Find the folder called mods. If there isnt one, right click to create a new folder and name it mods.

Drag and drop your the mod jar into this folder.
